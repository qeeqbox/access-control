## Access Control
Access Control is using security techniques to protect a system against unauthorized access

#### Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)
Access based on attributes or characteristics (user attributes, object attributes, and environment conditions)

#### Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
Access based on owner decision (The data owner determines the access)

#### Graph-based Access Control (GBAC)
Access based on how data relates to other data (E.g., using organizational query language)

#### History-Based Access Control (HBAC)
Access based on real-time evaluation of a history of activities

#### Identity-Based Access ControlÂ (IBAC)
Access based on the identity of the user (A specific user has access to sensitive information, this access is by the individual, not by group)

#### Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
Access based on regulations by a central authority (Users must demonstrate a need for the information before granting access) 

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Access based on a user role (E.g., job title)

#### Rule-Based Access Control (RAC)
Access based on a predefined set of rules or access permissions (E.g., allow access to specific IP)

#### Responsibility-Based Access Control (ReBAC)
Access based on the responsibilities assigned to user or users (Data engineer has access to backup management interface)
